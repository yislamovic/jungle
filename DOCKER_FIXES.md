# Docker Image Fix - Summary

## Issue
Product images were not displaying when running the Docker production build.

## Root Cause
The `db/seeds.rb` file was using the old CarrierWave image upload approach with `open_asset()`, which attempts to upload files through CarrierWave. However, the application was refactored to use a simpler static file approach with `image_filename` field instead.

The seed file was trying to assign File objects to the `image` field, but the Product model no longer has CarrierWave mounted and instead uses:
- `image_filename` database field to store the filename
- `image_url` method that returns `/images/#{image_filename}`
- Static images stored in `public/images/` directory

## Fix Applied
Replaced the content of `db/seeds.rb` with the correct seeding approach from `db/simple_seeds.rb`:
- Products now use `image_filename: 'apparel1.jpg'` instead of `image: open_asset('apparel1.jpg')`
- Images are served directly from `public/images/` directory
- No CarrierWave uploading or processing required

## Files Modified
1. **db/seeds.rb** - Updated to use simple file reference approach
2. **docker-compose.prod.yml** - Fixed to use `env_file` for proper environment variable loading

## Verification
✅ All 12 products seed correctly with proper image filenames
✅ Images are accessible at `/images/{filename}.jpg`
✅ HTTP 200 responses for all image requests
✅ Product listing page displays all product images correctly

## How Images Work Now
1. Image files are stored in `public/images/` (copied during Docker build via `COPY . .`)
2. Products reference images by filename only (e.g., `apparel1.jpg`)
3. The `Product#image_url` method constructs the full path: `/images/apparel1.jpg`
4. Rails serves static files directly from `public/` in production (via `RAILS_SERVE_STATIC_FILES=true`)

## No Longer Needed
- CarrierWave file uploading
- Image processing during seeding
- `public/uploads/` directory structure
- Seed asset files are kept for reference but not used during seeding
